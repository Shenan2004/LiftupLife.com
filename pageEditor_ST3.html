                <h2 id="feedback">Feedback Form</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>To make the feedback form easy to use and read, HTML and CSS were used in its design. The form appears more ordered because of the grouping of sections provided by fieldset and legend. For user input, the form uses input, textarea, and select tags. Patterns and other criteria are used to check for required fields. When users hover over a field, the title attribute provides additional information that makes it easier to understand what to enter . The star rating system makes feedback easy and enjoyable, while CSS enhances the appearance by adding borders, colors, and space.</p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Everyone, especially those with disabilities, can easily fill out the form. For the purpose of being read by screen readers, each input has a label. To help users in understanding each field, the title attribute gives more details. The form has easy-to-read error messages, large enough text, and clear colors. Radio options, buttons, and the rating Everyone can easily complete the form because stars may be used with a keyboard.</p>

                <h2 id="team">Team Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The "Team Page" uses HTML and CSS to create a simple and responsive design. The HTML structure includes tags like header, nav>, main, and footer to organize the content clearly. Each team member is inside a div with the class team-member, and tabindex="0" allows keyboard navigation, making it easier for users to interact.

                            CSS uses Flexbox (display: flex, justify-content: center, and gap: 30px) to place team members in a row and adjust for smaller screens with flex-wrap: wrap. Hover effects like transform: scale(1.05) and opacity: 0.8 make the cards more interactive. The member details are hidden (display: none) and show up on hover using display: flex.
                            
                            Simple fonts (font-family: Arial, sans-serif) and clear colors (#214358, #f5f5dc) make the page easy to read and look neat. Overall, the design is simple, user-friendly, and works well on different screen sizes.
                        </p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility in the "Team Page" was added by using tabindex="0" so users can move through team members with the keyboard. The role="button" tells screen readers the team members are clickable.
                            We used aria-expanded to show if details are open or closed and aria-label to describe the team member's details for screen readers. Simple tags like header, nav, main, and footer help organize the page so it's easy for everyone to use.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>This page uses basic HTML and CSS to make it look good and easy to navigate. HTML tags like header, nav, and footer help organize the page into sections, making it clear where each part starts and ends. The links are placed inside ul (unordered list) and li (list item) tags, which help organize them in a list format. Headings like h1, h2, and h3 are used to title sections and make the content easy to follow. In CSS, properties like background-color, padding, and border-radius help style the page, while Flexbox is used to arrange the menu links in a row that adjusts for different screen sizes. Media queries are also used to make the page look good on both big and small screens.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>To make the page more accessible, I added important features for people with disabilities. For example, I included descriptions (alt text) for images so that screen readers can explain them to users who can’t see the pictures. I also made sure the text has enough contrast with the background so it’s easy to read. The page has clear headings and lists, which helps people with screen readers understand the content better. There’s also a "Go to top" button that’s easy to use for people who can’t use a mouse. Overall, these choices make the website more usable for everyone.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>While working on the Feedback Form, Team Page, and Content Pages, I faced a challenge with making the pages look good on all devices. Some parts didn’t adjust well on smaller screens. To fix this, I updated the CSS to make the layout more flexible. Another challenge was making sure the pages were accessible, especially by adding alt text to images and checking screen reader compatibility. I solved this by carefully reviewing the pages. From these challenges, I learned that testing and paying attention to small details are key to creating easy-to-use, accessible websites.</p>

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>The Content Pages, Team Page, and Feedback Form were made in compliance with Janet's guidelines for publishing web pages. By using appropriate HTML structure, providing alt text to photos, and making them screen reader acceptable, I confirmed that every page is accessible. Additionally, I verified that the pages functioned properly across several kinds of screens and devices. I ensured that these pages adhere to the necessary guidelines for web publication, and they are simple to use and read. I did this according to the rules to make sure the pages are both compliant and easy to use.</p>
