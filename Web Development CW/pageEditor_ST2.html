                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The HTML structure uses semantic tags like header, nav, and footer to organize content logically, enhancing accessibility and maintainability. div containers structure sections like the “content-wrapper,” which employs CSS grid for a responsive two-column layout. Links (a) and hover effects (transform: scale(1.05)) make the page interactive, while smooth transitions (transition: transform 0.3s) improve user experience. Background images styled with background-size: cover; and background-position: center; visually enhance the content blocks. Padding, margins, and box shadows (box-shadow) add spacing and depth, while the meta viewport tag ensures mobile responsiveness. The warm color scheme and readable typography create an engaging and user-friendly design.</p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The home page incorporates accessibility features through the use of semantic HTML tags like header, nav, and footer, improving screen reader compatibility and content organization. Clear and descriptive link text within (a) tags ensures intuitive navigation, while the responsive design using the viewport meta tag adapts the layout for various devices. Consistent spacing, readable font sizes, and contrast between text and background enhance visual accessibility, making the page usable for a wider audience, including those with visual or physical impairments.</p>

                <h2 id="Table">Table Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The  code creates a webpage featuring a table that highlights the top three countries with the highest poverty rates, detailing contributing factors and poverty statistics. The table is styled using CSS for a clean and organized appearance, with features like border collapse, alternating row colors (nth-child), and hover effects to enhance readability and interactivity. The thead groups header content, while the tbody organizes data rows. Each cell (td) and heading (th) ensures semantic clarity, with icons and flags visually representing countries. The ✅ and - indicators provide quick visual cues for the presence or absence of factors, while clickable links (<a>) in certain cells direct users to additional resources. The table is centered using flexbox, and responsive design is supported with percentage-based widths, ensuring usability across devices.</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>The table enhances accessibility by using semantic HTML elements like thead and tbody for structured data organization, making it easier for screen readers to navigate. Clear column and row headers (th with descriptive content) improve context for users relying on assistive technologies. Visual indicators like flags and icons provide additional cues, while alternating row colors and hover effects improve readability for users with visual impairments. The responsive design ensures the table is accessible across various devices, and descriptive link text allows intuitive navigation to related resources.</p>

            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The HTML code  creates a well-structured webpage using semantic tags for clarity and accessibility. The header tag contains the site's logo and title, while the nav tag groups navigation links for easy site traversal. The main tag holds the primary content, divided into thematic sections using the section tag, each with its own heading defined by h1, h2, and h3. Hyperlinks are created with the (a) tag, allowing users to navigate between pages, and images are displayed using the img tag. Paragraphs of text are enclosed in p tags, and unordered lists of items are organized with ul and li tags. This combination of tags ensures a well-organized, accessible, and readable layout, enhancing both user experience and SEO.</p>
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>To ensure accessibility on the content page, clear and logical structure is maintained to make navigation easier for screen readers and users with disabilities. Descriptive alternative text is provided for images to convey their context to visually impaired users. A consistent and logical heading structure is used to help users navigate through the content effectively. Links are labeled with meaningful and descriptive text, ensuring that all users, including those with disabilities, can access the information without confusion.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>When developing the homepage,table and the content page the main problem that I encounted is using correct dimenstions of styling to the header,footer and navigation bar where it should look the same for everyone.Another problem that I faced is when making the table is to put the country logos next to the name which I solved as i read a lot of content on google.Finally adjusting styling in all three pages to make sure everyone can be able to understand and read clearly without any confusion was a challenge where i overcame it as well. </p>

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>The home page,table and content page have been designed in compliance with Janet regulations governing web page publication. These regulations emphasize accessibility, usability, and clarity. The pages follow proper semantic structure, use accessible features like alternative text for images and meaningful link descriptions, and maintain logical navigation for ease of use. The design ensures that content is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities, while adhering to best practices for web accessibility and regulatory standards.</p>
