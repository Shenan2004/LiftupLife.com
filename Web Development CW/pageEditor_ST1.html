                <h2 id="splash">Splash Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>I used the HTML file called "splashscree.html" to code the basic things that needed to creat the website. And for the styling i used Embedded CSS so everything is in the HTML flie
                            for the background image i used a png file that I created using the paint software and make it myself. I import the png image file to the CSS styling part where i used id CSS 
                            selector called ".splash" where everything in that I included in the page is on a div tag where it links to a ID called ".splash". This is how I import the background-image 
                            "background: url("splashEX.png") no-repeat center center/cover;". So for the text in side that div tag the color i selected is white cause the background-image is black color 
                            to match that i used white color. Also for the logo we have 2 png files for the logo. One is the logo with the black colour and the other one is white colour, to match with the 
                            black background-image we used the white logo. Also for the title we used "LiftUpLives" since the topic we choose was poverty. For the website title we used "LiftUpLives.org"
                            with our logo "link rel="icon" type="x" href="logoW.png" we used this code of line to get that done. For the text in the splash screen i didn't used a Specific text format.
                            And i implement our names using the same way that we used to make a navigation bar in our lecture and tutorial. Their styling was done in a CSS class called "groupnames". 
                            And I insert a simple loading animesion using "keyframes" where I learned watching a youtube video. And the styling part of that loading animesion was done in a CSS class called 
                            loading. For the transition I used only a one line of HTML code in side the head tag "meta http-equiv="refresh" content="4; URL='Homepage.html'" to go to our homepage after 
                            4 seconds.
                        </p> 
                    
                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Everyone can see this loading screen when they log to our splash screen. Through the splash screen html.</p>
                    
                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the splash page -->

            <section>
                <h2 id="volunteer">Volunteer Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>For I first look to the specification deeply and try to understand what are the thing that should be included in to the volunteer page. First I opend a html file called volunteer and link the Global CSS file to the html file and It was a bit hard compare to the splash screen.
                             cause its way different and complicated so i look into the lecture slides and found out the exact way. But everything wasn't there so I have to watch some resource videos from the YouTube also. And choosing the volunteer programs I used acctual ones I googled for a povetry volunteer 
                              programms and I used that websites exact volunteer programs. Everything was real. And for the other part rather than the scrollable-section I just typed what was givven in the example in our CourseWork specification.
                        </p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Accessibility in volunteer page was just there are some hover effects and the link won't take you anywhere, they were used to but i changed it cause I got some errors when I'm validating the code.</p>

                    <h3>Link to the validation page</h3> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the splash page -->
                        <p><a href="validation_ST1.html#volunteerVal">Link to validation page</a></p> <!-- Update the path to link the Page Editor with the validation page and make it jump to the marker that contains a snapshot for the splash page -->

            <section>
                <h2 id="content">Content Page</h2>
                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>I created a HTML file called "content3.html" for my part of the content. We used our headers and footer and to style them I used the "Global.css" file. The tpoic I choose was 
                            Solutions for the poverty. I used a div tag and use a class selector called content to do the styling part for it. I also link the pageEditor_validator CSS external file to 
                            style the Go To Top button. In the Introduction part I used navigational links to go straight to the topic. I used 3 images two of them are "webp" files while other one is a 
                            "jpeg" file. For the content 1.6 line spacing whith font size 19px. I used left margine-left styling to adjust the images. And other thing are from the global CSS external file</p> 

                    <h3>Accessibility</h3>
                        <p>Explain how you used to addressed accessibility in this particular page you implemented.</p>

                <h2 id="challenge"> Challenges and Lessons Learned</h2>
                    <p>I was so excited to do the splash screen but after I read the course work specification I figure out it was no an easy task but compare want others have splashscreewas way easier. So
                        making the splash screen was a challenge I using YouTube I manage to make a Splash screen. But I used HTML, CSS and JavaScript for that, after I makeing our splash screen I read the 
                        Course work Specification again and it didn't mention anything about using JavaScript for it I was kinda paniced but in the lecture slides there was a way to do that JavaScript work
                        using a single HTML line. Content page was not a challenge comapre to other tow tasks. But i learnedhow to make a content page. But making the Volunteer page was a difficult task compare to 
                        other two but thanks to lecture slides and proper guideness from lectures and tutors I manage to deliver a fine volunteer page.

                <h2 id="compliance"> Compliance</h2>
                    <p>The Content Pages, Slap screen, and Volunteer page were made in compliance with Janet's guidelines for publishing web pages. By using appropriate HTML structure, providing alt text to photos,
                         and making them screen reader acceptable, I confirmed that every page is accessible. Additionally, I verified that the pages functioned properly across several kinds of screens and devices.
                          I ensured that these pages adhere to the necessary guidelines for web publication, and they are simple to use and read. I did this according to the rules to make sure the pages are both compliant and easy to use.</p>
