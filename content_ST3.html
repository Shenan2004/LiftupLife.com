        <p class="intro-text">
            Poverty is a pressing global issue affecting billions of people worldwide. It is not simply about a lack of money — it is a deeply rooted problem caused by a combination of economic, social, political, and environmental factors. Understanding these causes is crucial for developing effective solutions to break the cycle of poverty and create lasting change. Below, we explore the key causes of poverty under four main categories.

            <h2>1. Economic Causes of Poverty</h2>
            <p>Economic factors are one of the most significant drivers of poverty. Financial instability, lack of opportunities, and income inequality prevent individuals from securing a stable livelihood.</p>
            
            <h3>1.1 Unemployment and Underemployment</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/unemployement.png" alt="Visual representation of global unemployment statistics and its impact on poverty">
                <p class="image-caption">Global unemployment statistics and their impact on poverty rates</p>
            </div>
            <p>Unemployment leaves individuals without a source of income, while underemployment — working in low-paying or insecure jobs — keeps families in poverty despite being employed.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>South Africa: The unemployment rate stood at 34.5% in 2021, with youth unemployment reaching a staggering 60%. Many educated young people struggle to find stable jobs, leading to widespread poverty. The lack of job opportunities for skilled workers has created a generation of frustration and financial insecurity, contributing to social unrest.</li>
                <li>India: Faces widespread underemployment, where millions work in informal sectors for minimal wages, often earning less than $2 a day. Many individuals lack benefits such as healthcare, social security, or job stability, exacerbating their vulnerability to financial instability. Even full-time workers may not earn enough to meet their family's basic needs, leaving them in a constant struggle to survive.</li>
                </ul>
            <p>Both unemployment and underemployment reduce people's ability to afford basic needs like food, healthcare, and education, making it harder to escape poverty. This economic insecurity prevents individuals from investing in their future, whether through further education or by saving for emergencies. As a result, the cycle of poverty is reinforced, creating barriers to long-term socio-economic mobility.
            </p>

            <h3>1.2 Income Inequality</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/inequality.png" alt="Illustration showing the wealth gap between different social classes in the US">
                <p class="image-caption">Illustration showing the wealth gap between different social classes in the US</p>
            </div>
            <p>Income inequality occurs when wealth is concentrated among a small portion of the population, leaving others with limited resources and opportunities.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>United States: The richest 1% own more wealth than the bottom 90% combined, making it difficult for low-income families to climb the economic ladder. This extreme concentration of wealth not only limits economic mobility but also influences political decisions that perpetuate the divide. Many families struggle to meet basic needs, while a small group enjoys unprecedented levels of wealth and power, reinforcing social and economic inequality.</li>
                <li>India: Billionaires amass enormous wealth while millions live below the poverty line, showcasing the stark divide between the rich and the poor. The vast wealth disparity means that the country's economic growth often fails to benefit the majority. A large portion of the population works in low-wage jobs or in the informal sector, with limited access to opportunities for advancement, education, or health services.</li>
                <li>44% of world population lives on less than $6.85 per day, the poverty line for upper-middle income countries</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without fair income distribution, poverty becomes entrenched, as marginalized groups struggle to access education, healthcare, and stable jobs. The inability to access quality education and healthcare further limits social mobility, creating a vicious cycle where the poor remain poor. Those in lower income brackets often have to work multiple jobs to make ends meet, leaving little time or resources to invest in opportunities that could improve their circumstances. In the absence of systemic change, inequality becomes a major barrier to breaking the cycle of poverty, trapping entire generations in disadvantage.</p>

            <h3>1.3 Economic Instability and Inflation</h3>
            <p>Economic crises and inflation reduce purchasing power, pushing more people into poverty. As inflation skyrockets, the cost of living increases faster than wages, making it difficult for individuals and families to maintain their standard of living. Basic needs such as food, housing, and healthcare become unaffordable, trapping people in poverty.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Zimbabwe's Hyperinflation: In the 2000s, Zimbabwe experienced one of the worst cases of hyperinflation in history, reaching a staggering 89.7 billion percent. This level of inflation rendered even everyday goods unaffordable, as the value of the Zimbabwean dollar plummeted. People were forced to carry bags of cash just to buy basic necessities like bread and milk. The financial collapse decimated savings and led to widespread poverty, with businesses closing and unemployment soaring.</li>
                <li>Venezuela's Economic Crisis: In 2018, Venezuela's inflation rate soared past 65,000%, pushing over 90% of the population into poverty. The inflation was so extreme that basic goods, including food and medicine, were priced beyond the reach of the average citizen. This economic collapse forced millions to migrate in search of better opportunities, leaving behind a nation struggling to rebuild. Along with hyperinflation, the country also faced food shortages, the collapse of public services, and widespread unemployment.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Economic instability creates a vicious cycle — as people become poorer, they spend less, further slowing economic growth.</p>

        <section id="social" class="section">
            <h2>2. Social Causes of Poverty</h2>
            <p>Social inequalities and lack of access to essential services also play a crucial role in perpetuating poverty.</p>

            <h3>2.1 Lack of Education</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/education.jpg" alt="Children without access to education in developing regions">
                <p class="image-caption">Children without access to education in developing regions</p>
            </div>
            <p>Education is a powerful tool for breaking the cycle of poverty, yet millions of children lack access to quality schooling.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Sub-Saharan Africa: In sub-Saharan Africa, an estimated 32 million children of primary school age are not enrolled in school, with girls disproportionately affected. The lack of schools, trained teachers, and resources, combined with cultural barriers, keeps many children, especially girls, from receiving an education. In some areas, poverty forces families to prioritize basic survival needs, leaving little to no funds for education. Furthermore, traditional gender norms may discourage the education of girls, limiting their opportunities for a better future.</li>
                <li>Rural India: In rural India, families often prioritize boys' education, leaving girls with limited future job prospects. Cultural expectations and gender biases result in families investing more in the education of sons, while daughters are often tasked with household chores and caregiving duties. This gender gap in education limits girls' access to higher education and professional opportunities, perpetuating the cycle of poverty for women. In many rural areas, the lack of schools, the long distance to the nearest school, and financial barriers further prevent children from accessing education.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Education is crucial for breaking the cycle of poverty. Without it, children face limited employment opportunities, lower earning potential, and a higher risk of living in poverty as adults. To create lasting change, it is essential to invest in education, particularly for marginalized groups, to ensure that every child has the opportunity to learn and thrive. Governments, NGOs, and communities must work together to improve access to education and remove the barriers that prevent children from attending school.</p>

            <h3>2.2 Poor Health and Disease</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/health.jpg" alt="Lack of health care facilities">
                <p class="image-caption">Lack of health care facilities</p>
            </div>
            <p>Health issues and lack of medical care push families further into poverty. When individuals fall ill, they often face the double burden of lost income and high healthcare costs, trapping them in a cycle of financial hardship. Poor health not only limits a person's ability to work but also places a heavy strain on family resources, forcing many to sell assets or take on debt to afford treatment.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>HIV/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa: In sub-Saharan Africa, HIV/AIDS affects nearly 70% of global cases, forcing families to spend their savings on treatment, transportation to clinics, and medications. The loss of breadwinners due to HIV/AIDS further deepens poverty, as children are often pulled out of school to care for sick relatives or to find work to support the family. This creates an intergenerational cycle of poverty, where poor health directly affects both the current and future economic stability of families.</li>
                <li>Malaria's Impact in Africa: Malaria kills over 600,000 people annually, mostly children in Africa, preventing breadwinners from working and supporting their families. Frequent malaria infections weaken individuals, reducing their productivity at work or on farms. For families dependent on agriculture, a single season of missed work due to illness can result in food shortages and financial collapse. Additionally, the cost of mosquito nets, medications, and hospital visits forces many families to choose between healthcare and other essential needs like food and education.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Poor health reduces productivity and drains household incomes, reinforcing poverty cycles.</p>

            <h3>2.3 Systemic Inequality and Discrimination</h3>
            <p>Discrimination based on gender, race, or ethnicity restricts access to jobs, education, and resources. These systemic inequalities create barriers that prevent marginalized groups from securing stable employment, receiving quality education, or owning property. As a result, poverty becomes more entrenched, making it harder for affected communities to break free from its grip.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Discrimination based on gender, race, or ethnicity restricts access to jobs, education, and resources. These systemic inequalities create barriers that prevent marginalized groups from securing stable employment, receiving quality education, or owning property. As a result, poverty becomes more entrenched, making it harder for affected communities to break free from its grip.</li>
                <li>In the United States, African American and Hispanic families experience poverty at higher rates than white families, stemming from systemic racism in housing, education, and employment. Historical practices like redlining have excluded minority families from homeownership and wealth accumulation, while underfunded schools in predominantly minority neighborhoods limit access to quality education. Job discrimination and wage gaps further restrict their economic mobility, ensuring that poverty cycles continue within these communities.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Inequality denies marginalized groups the tools they need to escape poverty, further widening the gap between the rich and the poor.</p>
        </section>

        <section id="political" class="section">
            <h2>3. Political Causes of Poverty</h2>
            <p>Political instability, corruption, and conflict also drive poverty by mismanaging resources and creating chaos.</p>

            <h3>3.1 Political Instability and Corruption</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/corruption.jpg" alt="Effects of political corruption on poverty ">
                <p class="image-caption">Effects of political corruption on poverty. </p>
            </div>
            <p>Corruption takes money meant to help people in poverty and puts it into the hands of dishonest leaders. At the same time, unstable governments fail to create good plans or policies to support their citizens. When public funds are stolen, there is less money to build schools, hospitals, and roads. This means fewer services for those who need them most. Political instability also scares away businesses and investors, slowing down the economy and making it harder for people to find jobs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Nigeria: About $400 billion has been lost to corruption since the country gained independence. This has taken money away from important services like healthcare, education, and infrastructure. As a result, hospitals lack medicine, schools are poorly built, and roads remain broken. Families are often forced to pay for private healthcare or schooling, which they can't afford, pushing them even deeper into poverty.</li>
                <li>Haiti: More than 60% of the population lives below the poverty line because of poor leadership and mismanagement of foreign aid. Despite receiving billions in international aid after natural disasters, much of the money never reached the people. Projects to improve roads, electricity, and clean water were left unfinished, keeping basic services out of reach for many.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Corruption and weak leadership stop resources from helping the people who need them most. When leaders focus on their own wealth instead of public welfare, the gap between the rich and the poor grows. Social programs are ignored, and people lose faith in their government. Political instability causes even more problems, like conflict and job losses, pushing more families into poverty. To reduce poverty, countries must fight corruption and build stable, honest governments.</p>

            <h3>3.2 Armed Conflict and War</h3>
            <p>Conflicts destroy economies, displace populations, and disrupt access to essential services. War damages infrastructure like schools, hospitals, and roads, making it harder for people to access education, healthcare, and jobs. It forces families to flee their homes, leaving behind their livelihoods and belongings. With fewer job opportunities and rising food and fuel prices, poverty worsens as people struggle to survive.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In Yemen: Years of war have left 75% of the population dependent on humanitarian aid, with widespread food and medical shortages. Many hospitals have been destroyed or lack supplies, leaving people without proper healthcare. Families often skip meals, and malnutrition has become a major issue, especially among children. The fighting has also made it dangerous for aid groups to deliver food and medicine, making the situation even worse.</li>
                <li>In Syria: Over 80% of the population now lives in extreme poverty due to the ongoing civil war, which has devastated livelihoods and infrastructure. Homes, businesses, and schools have been destroyed, forcing families to live in overcrowded camps or unsafe conditions. Many people have lost their jobs, and inflation has made basic goods like bread and medicine unaffordable. Without stable incomes or support, families are trapped in a cycle of poverty that becomes harder to escape as the conflict drags on.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>War uproots communities and prevents recovery, deepening the poverty crisis. It creates lasting damage by breaking economies, scattering families, and limiting access to education and healthcare. Even when the fighting stops, it can take years to rebuild, leaving those affected struggling to overcome poverty for generations.</p>

            <h3>3.3 Poor Governance</h3>
            <p>Inefficient leadership and poor policy implementation worsen poverty by neglecting key social programs.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In Haiti, political instability has halted infrastructure projects, leaving communities without roads, schools, or healthcare facilities.</li>
                <li>Countries with unstable leadership struggle to create jobs or invest in education, further embedding poverty.</li>
                <li>Good governance is essential for sustainable development and poverty reduction.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Good governance is essential for sustainable development and poverty reduction. Strong leadership means creating fair policies, investing in public services, and ensuring funds are used to benefit the people. Without this, poverty continues to spread, making progress nearly impossible.</p>

        <section id="environmental" class="section">
            <h2>4. Environmental Causes of Poverty</h2>
            <p>The environment also plays a crucial role in poverty, as climate change and natural disasters disproportionately affect the poor.</p>

            <h3>4.1 Climate Change</h3>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src="images/climate-change.jpg" alt="Impact of climate change on agricultural communities and livelihoods">
                <p class="image-caption">Impact of climate change on agricultural communities and livelihoods</p>
            </div>
            <p>Climate change destroys livelihoods, particularly in agriculture-dependent regions. It leads to unpredictable weather patterns, including extreme droughts, floods, and storms, which damage crops and kill livestock. Farmers struggle to grow enough food to feed their families or sell at markets, causing their incomes to shrink. As farming becomes less reliable, many are forced to find other means of survival — often moving to cities in search of work, which adds pressure to already struggling urban areas.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>In Africa: Severe droughts have displaced millions, with failing crops and dying livestock pushing families into poverty. Water sources dry up, forcing people to travel long distances to find clean water. Farmers lose their cattle and sheep, their main source of income, leaving them unable to afford basic necessities like food and medicine.</li>
                <li>In Bangladesh: Rising sea levels have forced thousands to abandon their homes and lose their sources of income. Saltwater floods farmland, making it impossible to grow rice and other crops. Families are left without food or work, driving them into deeper poverty. Many end up living in overcrowded slums in larger cities, where jobs are scarce and living conditions are poor.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Climate change worsens poverty by reducing access to food, water, and stable housing. It creates a ripple effect — when farms fail, local economies collapse, and hunger spreads. With fewer resources, families have less money for education, healthcare, and rebuilding their homes. As natural disasters become more frequent and severe, the gap between those who can recover and those who cannot continues to widen, trapping vulnerable communities in a cycle of poverty.</p>

            </div>
            <p>Natural disasters wipe out years of progress in poverty reduction. They destroy homes, schools, and hospitals, leaving communities without shelter, education, or medical care. The sudden loss of livelihoods — whether it's farmers losing crops to floods or small businesses being wiped out by storms — pushes families deeper into poverty. With limited savings or support systems, the most vulnerable are often unable to rebuild, forcing them to rely on aid or migrate in search of safety and work.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Hurricane Matthew in Haiti (2016): The hurricane left 1.4 million people in need of humanitarian aid, destroying homes and livelihoods. Entire villages were flattened, and farms were wiped out, stripping families of their main food source and income. The storm also contaminated water supplies, leading to outbreaks of diseases like cholera, further worsening the crisis. With weak infrastructure and limited government support, many Haitians were left to rebuild their lives with little help, keeping them trapped in poverty.</li>
                <li>Typhoons in the Philippines: Typhoons regularly displace thousands, plunging already struggling families deeper into poverty. Houses made from fragile materials are easily destroyed, forcing families to live in overcrowded evacuation centers. Fishermen lose their boats, and farmers see their crops destroyed, cutting off their primary means of earning a living. Without proper insurance or government aid, people often borrow money to rebuild, pushing them into cycles of debt and hardship.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Without proper disaster response and recovery plans, affected communities remain trapped in poverty for generations. The lack of long-term support means families struggle to rebuild homes, send children back to school, or restore their businesses. As natural disasters become more frequent due to climate change, these vulnerable communities face even greater risks, with each disaster pushing them further away from financial stability and security.</p>
